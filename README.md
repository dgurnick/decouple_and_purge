## Decoupling

> **Concept:** Self-Isolation. Never-materializing Optimism.  
> **Theme:**  
> Still stay hopeful that this is just a temporary thing.  
> Goals for this year are in quarters (stabilise personally, locally, financially, then look outward).  
> Be a source of gravity for others.  
> It's 3/4 time in the style of Elliott Smith. Should be a bit aggressive.  
> It's also very normal rhyme here. Which is ok for pop culture.

[C# -> Ab -> A -> E]
-- Verse
Put my hat on the post of the bed
Fixed the hair on the back of my head
Close the blinds or they're gonna see
What their daughter is doing to me

    [A -> E -> Ab -> A -> E]
    Get me out of this place
    And give me some sanity
    Cuz I'm surely losing my mind
    the mind was mine all the time

    The hands that inspire, are keeping me down
    The lack of dependency
    With me as the clown

-- Verse
Lay beside. And shuffle the air.
Feel content just to be there.
Through the ocean, the waves and the sea.
Smile through drama and just let it be.

    The eyes without shadows
    Cold hardness of ground
    A floor without contact
    We'll see you around.

get me out of this place
and show me reality
cause I think I'm losing my mind
or perhaps it's just something inside

-- TODO: probably needs a bridge
-- TODO: another verse and chorus
-- TODO: outro

```

## Finer Print

> **Concept:** Information that isn't.  
> **Theme:**  
> Clinical assessment says nothing.  
> People are acting in their comfort zone and not thinking objectively.  

``` text
The notes. The points. The silence.
The texts. The distance. Quiet violence.
Of words and of meanings not understood.
The constant lost feelings.

-- TODO: Less poem more music.
-- TODO: Should be light and ethereal.

```

## Lay in Wait

> **Concept:** Expecting change.  
> **Theme:**  
> Sat by the river with a book.  
> Me. Birds. Ants. All the same.  
> Looking for a place to happen and finding stops along the way.  
> This is a walking C-Am progression. Another light song. Perhaps too light. Let's adjust.  

``` text
I can't deny
What was found beneath the ground
A life or two who let me be control

And now see my dad 
as he picks for junk along the beaches
The wood will break
The man just fades away

    -- bridge
    In quiet places to contemplate
    something so familiar
    that takes me closer to my day

    those quiet places where they lie to wait
    something so peculiar
    that takes me closer to my day

    -- chorus
    Down down Jaco hold me
    Another day, another crazy night away
    Old friend, console me
    Mothers ears have left me here
    away

The tragedy of the disappeared
Can't believe there's nothing better
That leads me closer to the grave

The tragedy. Is there something near?
Something so familiar?
That brings us close, so far away.

    Down down Jaco hold me
    Another day, another crazy night away
    Old friend, console me
    Mothers ears have left me here
    away

```

## Stella

> **Concept:** Not living in your own skin.  
> **Theme:**  
> It's an old theme.  
> You can't shake life into a rock.  

``` text
If you beat upon it
You'll hear the sound
Of the deepest bottom 
Ever found
And now, Stella are you home?

There's a wall of idea
Trapped inside
With imagination
still to find
And now, Stella are you home?

    Is it better to believe in the
    Distraction?
    Or do you need to be free of the
    Distraction?

to act so normal is so profound
to be indifferent as you hit the ground
but now, Stella are you home?

    Is it better to believe in the
    Distraction?
    Or do you need to be free of the
    Distraction?


-- TODO: This is another Am7 song with a hammer on the C to F. Could be a bit redundant. Rethink and don't be afraid of a Capo.

## Bigger Leaves

``` text
two-by-two, whatcha gonna do?
dynamo's gone, 
and the cat has lost his tongue again
maybe this time for good

cross the street with naked feet
the nail slides in but the pain
seems to disappear maybe this time for good

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

false alarm, no one was harmed
the puddle's gone dry from the stretch and the sting
of the pouring rain
maybe this time for real

a time ago when no one was home
we kicked down the door for more to have a peek inside
maybe this time for real

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

let me in, for original sin 
the pendulum swings
and the spring unwinds to rest a while
maybe this time for real

two-by-two whatcha gonna do?
dynamo's gone and the cat has lost his tongue again
maybe this time for good

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves
```

## Fallacy of Fail

> **Concept:** Staying optimistic. Rejecting status quo.  
> **Theme:**  
> "Never failed to fail" has no meaning.  
> Friends need strength. Relationships need balance.  

``` text

-- TODO: This one will need some thought. Concept is good but should be heavy and aggressive.

```

## Ghosts

> **Concept:** The innocence of not knowing how to communicate.  
> **Theme:**  
> Sign of the times. Selfish self-interest?  
> Silence (especially among friends) = know they damage but can't help themselves.  
> Move quietly in space.  
> Star clusters. Universe is expanding FTL.  
> Easy to mis-interpret. We lost the art of talking.  

``` text

## The Reliability of Predictability

> **Concept:** Being & encouraging change  
> **Theme:**  
> We are all the same profile. We are all fools.

> Sometimes you need to try to shake life into a rock.  
> If you can't say something good, swallow your tongue.  
> Aim for reciprocation and the long term.  

``` text

```

## So Much Home

> **Theme:**  
> Don't judge. Don't share. Don't be the gossip.

``` text

-- TODO: Again needs to be made into a song. Poems exist for this. GVG material

```

## Angel

> **Concept:** Beauty out of abandonment.  
> **Theme:**  
> Using past to build a future.  
> The absence of light is also power.  
> Should have a good rhythm. Ideally with drums, bass, 2 guitar parts.  

``` text

[C# -> F#]
this living Angel, is such a sight to see
though the heater has departed
leaving just the upkeep

just one more question
then it's time to hit the shore
is this existence all there is?
or is there more?

    [F# -> A -> C#]
    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    think it over
    as this dimension takes a turn
    to calm all those concerned

living inner tension
living in a dream
subtle comprehension: what's to come?
and what's to be?

have a look my child
at the shores and stars outside
all that's yours and mine

    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    think it over

```

## Window

> **Concept:** Fighting at all costs. Never giving up.  
> **Theme:**  
> A broken window half buried in the sand.  
> A man pulling it out to build shelter.  
> Broken but still useful.  

``` text

[C Em Am]
Brave be the window
Who tried to be
Much more than the man could ever take

Down by the seaside
Along the shore
Alone with faded memories
From long before

    -- bridge
    I'm not the only one
    Who sees, am i?
    These twisted shades of memory
    Though black and white
    
    Oh, the time has come
    For this singular, expressive phase
    To come undone

    -- chorus
    [F G# C G]
    [F G# C G Eb]
    It'll never make it through
    If the sand can get the best of you
    You've thrown it all away
    It's enough to keep the elements of consequence
    at bay

Maybe a whisper
Maybe a sound
The window fell under
To bring me around

To many questions
I'm not surprised
It's just the guy they knew
Who was left there to die

    -- chorus
    It'll never make it through
    Ff the sand can get the best of you
    You've thrown it all away
    It's enough to keep the elements of consequence
    at bay

-- TODO: Feels a bit over the top. Simplify it.

## The Short Story of Jaco

These are just the notes. Will expand the actual story line into something more concrete.

**Concept:**  

- A boy born on a farm. Mother dies during birth.
- A dog is adopted. "Jaco"
- Father goes mad and runs away to the sea.  
- Think farm somewhere central Alberta.  
- Large with only one railway that runs a single train every few days.
- The train stop is near the farm.  
- The boy, now alone, raises himself without any human contact. Together with Jaco.  
- As a young teen, confused and having never left the farm, the boy takes the train to the nearest town.  
- "Where is my father? Is this where he went?"
- Never seeing society. Never saw technology. Steps out on the street and pleasures himself in an intersection. So much chaos and noise.  
- Locals panic and he is arrested. Eventually returned home.  
- At home, he discovers that Jaco has passed away. Old and malnourished.
- Never experiencing death, the boy uses comics that his dad left behind to stuff the dog.  
- Jaco lives on in silence. Immobile.  
- No trauma. No sadness.  
- The boy returns to the city at regular intervals and begins to bring people home. Are people so gullable?  
- Brings them home, and buries them in the garden. The vegetables grow.  
- Growing up. Dozens of mounds in the garden. Jaco decaying and falling apart.  
- Something is calling him.  
- He takes the train but does not stop as usual. Final stop is at the ocean.
- Never saw the sea. Never heard it.  
- Finds his father. The attraction to the water is their instinct.  
- Living under a pier. Improvised with drift-wood and scraps that washed ashore.  
- Sees his father pulling hopelessly on a window.  Something to give light.  
- The window breaks.  
- Nothing ever survives.  

**Eternal**  
My name: Achilles. I could push you Tortoise, but you'd just pop back up and reappear ... like you've done now a thousand times. I could chase you "Tortoise", but's no matter how fast I run, you'll always be one-step away.

I've asked you to reward me. To show me just one hint that you are here with me. Each time I have been disappointed. What should I do?

My father has left me. Here with my friend Jaco, the dog. But Jaco does not answer. The comics I have filled him with have done nothing to improve life. Comics don't answer. What should I do?

If I were born a spider, I would have the legs to keep balance. But I was born a man, at least I think that's what I am.

Is there something in my head? Shall we find out when I'm dead? If you can prove it, I will believe it. Be aware, I am a  material, I must see this evidence.

**Another Place**  
I went on a rocket to the place with people today. So much confusion in this social stand. What is the point of it all? Standing there, in the intersection between me and them. Pants down. Pleasure. So much rage.

Where is my father? What has he become? Is he again at the sea? Where the piers jettison out like some fragile, broken arms ... fragile, and wooden across the sea. Why would he leave? Did Jaco disappoint him too?

**Footprints**  
Look at this child, so innocent in their ways. Though the giver has left, I believe things will be okay. I wonder what kind of life? Perhaps existence will be less distilled than mine. I must provide this child with a way to live.

**Stella**  
Hey you! It's me again, Achilles, your master. Join me to my home and I will show you Jaco. He is kind to strangers, unlike yourself who seems so distant. Why do you ignore me? Shall I show you to the place you desire? I can, you know.

**The Lawn**  
See my lawn? It's right there behind you. Those little mountains are of my and their creation. There is still life in those mountains, more that you can ever imagine. Now so still. If you like, I will consume you into those hills. That is their purpose.

**Bigger Leaves**  
Hey, it's me, the tortoise. Remember me achilles? The one you could push but could not pop. My, how you have grown. And where is your father? I heard he has not been seen for some time. Tell him I said hello when you seem him.

This place of yours seems so placid today yet somehow I have the idea that it is busy. Have you been gardening? The flowers are so vivid and straight.

**Humility**  
Hello Tortoise. It is I, Achilles. I will take you now, you should be prepared.

**Jaco**  
I admit I have been deviant, but only to myself. I do not know these people you say I have destroyed. How can I be guilty of a crime upon these people if they did not refuse? How can Jaco have helped me, he does not know of this world any more. You think there's something here, in my head?

**Carried Through**  
After so little time, I have failed. My son is nothing more than I could never be. After the protection of my home, guarding from this place some call existence, there has become nothing of that boy. If only I didn't feel so trapped in this situation. If only I could have had the imagination to create a person of their own free will.

**Window**  
After it all, Achilles, you are still transparent. You've never developed a character, at least nothing of color or substance. You see me? Your father. I have been successful. These dying pieces of ships and trees have given birth to my home, here under the piers. I need only that window for completion. This is an endless loop.

**Cold Water**  
Father, you are a fool. You can not push me, as was Jaco. People speak my name when I am not present. I barely remembered your face. If you like this isolation, you must learn to bleed. This has been the way I have lived my life. It is the
way it will end.

## Jaco

In the heart of central Alberta, on a sprawling farm, a boy was born into a world of solitude. His mother's life slipped away during his birth, leaving him to enter the world without her loving embrace. His father, a quiet and stoic man, tried his best to raise the boy, but the weight of his grief and the responsibilities of the farm proved too much to bear. One day, he went mad and ran away to the distant sea, leaving behind the farm and his young son.

Alone in the vastness of the farm, the boy found solace in the company of a loyal companion, a dog he named Jaco. Together, they roamed the fields and played among the crops. The only connection to the outside world was the solitary railway that ran near their farm, with a single train passing through every few days.

As the years passed, the boy grew into a young teen, curious about the world beyond the farm. One day, he decided to take the train to the nearest town, hoping to find his father and discover where he had gone. Stepping off the train, he was overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of society—people rushing about, cars honking, and the constant hum of technology. It was a world he had never imagined, let alone experienced.

Confused and disoriented, the boy found himself in the middle of a bustling intersection. In a moment of uninhibited curiosity, he acted on a primal urge and found pleasure with himself. Pants down to the ankle. The locals panicked, and chaos ensued. He was arrested and eventually returned to the farm, still bewildered by the complexities of the outside world.

When he returned home, he discovered that Jaco had passed away, old and malnourished from the years of isolation. The boy had never experienced death before, and in a strange act of reverence, he used comics left behind by his father to stuff the dog, preserving Jaco's form as a silent and immobile companion.

With time, the boy's longing for human interaction grew, and he began bringing people from the nearby town back to the farm. They were easily convinced to follow him, their trust in his innocence and isolation proving their downfall. The boy buried them in the garden, and the vegetables he planted above their graves grew robust and hearty.

As he grew older, the boy amassed dozens of mounds in the garden, each one a testament to his strange and macabre ritual. Jaco, who had once been his only friend, began to decay and fall apart, a silent witness to the boy's growing obsession.

But something was calling him, a mysterious force that he couldn't resist. He boarded the train again, this time with a determined purpose. He didn't stop at the familiar town near the farm but rode it to its final destination — the ocean. He had never seen the sea, never heard its siren song.

At the coast, he ventured beneath a pier and discovered his father, living a hopeless existence, sheltered in an improvised structure made of driftwood and scraps washed ashore. His father pulled desperately on a makeshift window, trying to let in a sliver of light. In his desperation, the window broke, and the boy realized that nothing ever truly survives.

Together, they found solace in the sea, drawn to it by an instinct they couldn't comprehend. They joined the ever-rolling waves, disappearing into the vastness of the ocean, leaving behind the farm, the garden of secrets, and the decaying form of Jaco. In the end, they were just two lost souls, seeking refuge in the relentless embrace of the sea, where the chaos and noise of the world above were silenced by the eternal depths below.
