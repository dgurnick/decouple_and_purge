## Decoupling

> **Concept:** Self-Isolation. Never-materializing Optimism.
> **Theme:**
> Still stay hopeful that this is just a temporary thing.
> Goals for this year are in quarters (stabilise personally, locally, financially, then look outward).
> Be a source of gravity for others.

> It's 3/4 time in the style of Elliott Smith. Should be a bit aggressive.
> It's also very normal rhyme here. Which is ok for pop culture.

-- Verse
Put my hat on the post of the bed
Fixed the hair on the back of my head
Close the blinds or they're gonna see
What their daughter is doing to me

-- Chorus (kind of)
The hands that inspire, are keeping me down
The lack of dependency
With me as the clown

-- Verse
Lay beside. And shuffle the air.
Feel content just to be there.
Through the ocean, the waves and the sea.
Smile through drama and just let it be.

-- Chorus (kind of)
The eyes without shadows
Cold hardness of ground
A floor without contact
We'll see you around.

-- TODO: probably needs a bridge
-- TODO: another verse and chorus
-- TODO: outro

```

## Finer Print

> **Concept:** Information that isn't.
> **Theme:**
> Clinical assessment says nothing.
> People are acting in their comfort zone and not thinking objectively.

``` text
The notes. The points. The silence.
The texts. The distance. Quiet violence.
Of words and of meanings not understood.
The constant lost feelings.

-- TODO: Less poem more music.
-- TODO: Should be light and ethereal.

```

## Static vs Noise

> **Concept:** Self-reflection with a constant ringing in your ears
> **Theme:**
> Stop reaching out if it's not needed.
> It's ok to rely on yourself.
> Technology is poison.

``` text
Two by two
Whatcha gonna do?
Dynamo's gone
And the cat lost its tongue again
Maybe this time for real

A time ago
When no one was home
We kicked down the door
For more
To have a look inside
Maybe this time for real

-- chorus 
You're the saddest tree
I ever did see
But you grew so well
In the shade of bigger leaves

Let me in
For original sin
The puddle's gone dry
From the stretch and the sting of the pouring rain
Maybe this time for real

-- TODO: Other verse
-- TODO: bridge
-- TODO: chorus and outro
-- TODO: will be grunge-ish. Cuz why not?

```

## Lay in Wait

> **Concept:** Expecting change.
> **Theme:**
> Sat by the river with a book.
> Me. Birds. Ants. All the same.
> Looking for a place to happen and finding stops along the way.

> This is a walking C-Am progression. Another light song. Perhaps too light. Let's adjust.

``` text
I can't deny
What was found beneath the ground
A life or two who let me be control

And now see my dad 
as he picks for junk along the beaches
The wood will break
The man just fades away

The tragedy of the disappeared
Can't believe there's nothing better
That leads me closer to the grave

The tragedy. Is there something near?
Something so familiar?
That brings us close, so far away.

Down down Jaco hold me
Another day, another crazy night away
Old friend, console me
Mothers ears have left me here
away
```

## Stella

> **Concept:** Not living in your own skin.
> **Theme:**
> It's an old theme.
> You can't shake life into a rock.

``` text
If you beat upon it
You'll hear the sound
Of the deepest bottom 
Ever found
And now, Stella are you home?

There's a wall of idea
Trapped inside
With imagination
no one will find
And now, Stella are you home?

Is it better to believe in the
Distraction?
Or do you need to be free of the
Distraction?

-- TODO: This is another Am7 song with a hammer on the C to F. Could be a bit redundant. Rethink and don't be afraid of a Capo.

```

## Fallacy of Fail

> **Concept:** Staying optimistic. Rejecting status quo.
> **Theme:**
> "Never failed to fail" has no meaning.
> Friends need strength. Relationships need balance.

``` text

-- TODO: This one will need some thought. Concept is good but should be heavy and aggressive.

```

## Ghosts

> **Concept:** The innocence of not knowing how to communicate.
> **Theme:**
> Sign of the times. Selfish self-interest?
> Silence (especially among friends) = know they damage but can't help themselves.
> Move quietly in space.
> Star clusters. Universe is expanding FTL.
> Easy to mis-interpret. We lost the art of talking.

``` text 

-- TODO: Needs a phased guitar part. Not too distorted.
-- TODO: Also needs, you know, to be an actual song.

```

## The Reliability of Predictability

> **Concept:** Being & encouraging change
> **Theme:**
> We are all the same profile. We are all fools.
> Nothing changes. We are all predictable disappointments without intention.
> Sometimes you need to try to shake life into a rock.
> If you can't say something good, swallow your tongue.
> Aim for reciprocation and the long term.

``` text

-- TODO: This might just be instrumental based on what I sent Patty last year. Good progression but maybe a bit abstract. Think about making it more listenable. But for who?

```

## So Much Home

> **Concept:** Being strange. Being comfortable where ever you are.
> **Theme:**
> Don't judge. Don't share. Don't be the gossip.
> Don't push. Listen. Don't make things awkward.
> Avoid toxicity. No. Ignore it.

``` text 

-- TODO: Again needs to be made into a song. Poems exist for this. GVG material

```
