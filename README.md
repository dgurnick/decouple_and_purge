## Decoupling

> **Concept:** Self-Isolation. Never-materializing Optimism.  
> **Theme:**  
> Still stay hopeful that this is just a temporary thing.  
> Goals for this year are in quarters (stabilise personally, locally, financially, then look outward).  
> Be a source of gravity for others.  
> It's 3/4 time in the style of Elliott Smith. Should be a bit aggressive.  
> It's also very normal rhyme here. Which is ok for pop culture.

[C# -> Ab -> A -> E]
-- Verse
Put my hat on the post of the bed
Fixed the hair on the back of my head
Close the blinds or they're gonna see
What their daughter is doing to me


    [A -> E -> Ab -> A]
    The hands that inspire, are keeping me down
    The lack of dependency
    With me as the clown

-- Verse
Lay beside. And shuffle the air.
Feel content just to be there.
Through the ocean, the waves and the sea.
Smile through drama and just let it be.

    The eyes without shadows
    Cold hardness of ground
    A floor without contact
    We'll see you around.

get me out of this place
and show me reality
cause I think I'm losing my mind
or perhaps it's just something inside

-- TODO: probably needs a bridge
-- TODO: another verse and chorus
-- TODO: outro

```

## Finer Print

> **Concept:** Information that isn't.  
> **Theme:**  
> Clinical assessment says nothing.  
> People are acting in their comfort zone and not thinking objectively.  

``` text
The notes. The points. The silence.
The texts. The distance. Quiet violence.
Of words and of meanings not understood.
The constant lost feelings.

-- TODO: Less poem more music.
-- TODO: Should be light and ethereal.

```

## Lay in Wait

> **Concept:** Expecting change.  
> **Theme:**  
> Sat by the river with a book.  
> Me. Birds. Ants. All the same.  
> Looking for a place to happen and finding stops along the way.  
> This is a walking C-Am progression. Another light song. Perhaps too light. Let's adjust.  

``` text
I can't deny
What was found beneath the ground
A life or two who let me be control

And now see my dad 
as he picks for junk along the beaches
The wood will break
The man just fades away

    -- bridge
    In quiet places to contemplate
    something so familiar
    that takes me closer to my day

    those quiet places where they lie to wait
    something so peculiar
    that takes me closer to my day

    -- chorus
    Down down Jaco hold me
    Another day, another crazy night away
    Old friend, console me
    Mothers ears have left me here
    away

The tragedy of the disappeared
Can't believe there's nothing better
That leads me closer to the grave

The tragedy. Is there something near?
Something so familiar?
That brings us close, so far away.

    Down down Jaco hold me
    Another day, another crazy night away
    Old friend, console me
    Mothers ears have left me here
    away

```

## Stella

> **Concept:** Not living in your own skin.  
> **Theme:**  
> It's an old theme.  
> You can't shake life into a rock.  

``` text
If you beat upon it
You'll hear the sound
Of the deepest bottom 
Ever found
And now, Stella are you home?

There's a wall of idea
Trapped inside
With imagination
still to find
And now, Stella are you home?

    Is it better to believe in the
    Distraction?
    Or do you need to be free of the
    Distraction?

to act so normal is so profound
to be indifferent as you hit the ground
but now, Stella are you home?

    Is it better to believe in the
    Distraction?
    Or do you need to be free of the
    Distraction?


-- TODO: This is another Am7 song with a hammer on the C to F. Could be a bit redundant. Rethink and don't be afraid of a Capo.

```

## Bigger Leaves

> **Concept:** Growing out of the shadow  
> **Theme:**  
> Enjoying life & making memories.  
> Sharing and openness.  
> From the Story of Jaco.  

``` text
two-by-two, whatcha gonna do?
dynamo's gone, 
and the cat has lost his tongue again
maybe this time for good

cross the street with naked feet
the nail slides in but the pain
seems to disappear maybe this time for good

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

false alarm, no one was harmed
the puddle's gone dry from the stretch and the sting
of the pouring rain
maybe this time for real

a time ago when no one was home
we kicked down the door for more to have a peek inside
maybe this time for real

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

let me in, for original sin 
the pendulum swings
and the spring unwinds to rest a while
maybe this time for real

two-by-two whatcha gonna do?
dynamo's gone and the cat has lost his tongue again
maybe this time for good

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves

    you're the saddest tree i ever did see
    yet you grew so well in the shade of bigger leaves
```

## Fallacy of Fail

> **Concept:** Staying optimistic. Rejecting status quo.  
> **Theme:**  
> "Never failed to fail" has no meaning.  
> Friends need strength. Relationships need balance.  

``` text

-- TODO: This one will need some thought. Concept is good but should be heavy and aggressive.

```

## Ghosts

> **Concept:** The innocence of not knowing how to communicate.  
> **Theme:**  
> Sign of the times. Selfish self-interest?  
> Silence (especially among friends) = know they damage but can't help themselves.  
> Move quietly in space.  
> Star clusters. Universe is expanding FTL.  
> Easy to mis-interpret. We lost the art of talking.  

``` text

-- TODO: Needs a phased guitar part. Not too distorted.
-- TODO: Definitely electronic and should have a good beat. Think about changing the metre mid-song.
-- TODO: Also needs, you know, to be an actual song.

```

## The Reliability of Predictability

> **Concept:** Being & encouraging change  
> **Theme:**  
> We are all the same profile. We are all fools.  
> Nothing changes. We are all predictable disappointments without intention.  
> Sometimes you need to try to shake life into a rock.  
> If you can't say something good, swallow your tongue.  
> Aim for reciprocation and the long term.  

``` text

-- TODO: This might just be instrumental based on what I sent Patty last year. Good progression but maybe a bit abstract. Think about making it more listenable. But for who?

```

## So Much Home

> **Concept:** Being strange. Being comfortable where ever you are.  
> **Theme:**  
> Don't judge. Don't share. Don't be the gossip.  
> Don't push. Listen. Don't make things awkward.  
> Avoid toxicity. No. Ignore it.  

``` text

-- TODO: Again needs to be made into a song. Poems exist for this. GVG material

```

## Angel

> **Concept:** Beauty out of abandonment.  
> **Theme:**  
> Using past to build a future.  
> The absence of light is also power.  
> Should have a good rhythm. Ideally with drums, bass, 2 guitar parts.  

``` text

[C# -> F#]
this living Angel, is such a sight to see
though the heater has departed
leaving just the upkeep

just one more question
then it's time to hit the shore
is this existence all there is?
or is there more?

    [F# -> A -> C#]
    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    think it over
    as this dimension takes a turn
    to calm all those concerned

living inner tension
living in a dream
subtle comprehension: what's to come?
and what's to be?

have a look my child
at the shores and stars outside
all that's yours and mine

    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    even the shadow of a man
    can leave a footprint in the sand
    think it over

```
